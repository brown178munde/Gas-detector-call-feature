# LPG Gas Detector with Call Alert 🚨📞  
A Smart Solution for Enhanced Safety

This project is a proactive safety system designed to detect LPG gas leaks and instantly alert users via automated phone calls. Built using an MQ-5 gas sensor, GSM module, and Arduino, it’s ideal for homes, restaurants, food trucks, and industrial setups.

## 🔧 Key Components
- **MQ-5 Gas Sensor** – Detects LPG with high sensitivity  
- **GSM Module** – Sends automated call alerts to predefined numbers  
- **Arduino** – Handles control logic and communication  
- **5V DC Power Supply** – Powers the system reliably

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Gas Detection**: MQ-5 sensor identifies LPG presence  
2. **Alert Activation**: Arduino triggers buzzer/LED and GSM module  
3. **Call Alert**: GSM module dials preset numbers to notify users

## 🏠 Applications
- Domestic kitchens  
- Restaurants & food trucks  
- Industrial LPG zones  
- Gas storage/distribution facilities

---
## 🚀 Getting Started
